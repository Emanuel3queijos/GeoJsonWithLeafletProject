I think having enums instead of classes, in the sense of having a class with a list for each attribute of the table, might be a viable choice, or not, since using lists will be better for saving the data, as every dam is a body of water, but not every dam is a water withdrawal point. I think using enums only for tables that belong strictly to that specific group is still to be analyzed.

Upon further analysis, I realize that using enums alongside lists, in the case of saving attributes in a specific group, where an attribute can be shared among groups, saving it as an enum will facilitate the search for that attribute when referenced to the group in question. For instance, if a person wants to filter on the map only by the number of dams that are drainage points, simply passing the enum as a parameter will be sufficient to conduct the attribute search within the database.
